\begin{document}
Didot LT Pro has lowercase figures in both its roman and its italic;
however, the ‘onum’ feature is defined only for the roman.

When I fixed the problem with a feature file in older versions of
luatex and fontspec, the numbers did not copy and paste correctly;
now, with this new approach, they do.
